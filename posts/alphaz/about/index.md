### About alphaz

A former developer as a full-stack member.

Haha, that means you know I am neight good at front-end nor back-end!

Additionally, I am over 35+, a TBO(to be optimised) man, but I love coding, maybe just appreciate the creating new world or keeping moving.

Very glad to join the group, and I think perhaps here is on my right way.

Cheers!
